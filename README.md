2. Use of Pandas Library

## Mini Project 2

### Problem Description
This data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represents aggregate information about homes from various suburbs located in Boston. Once you get a good fit, you can use this model to predict the monetary value of a house located at the Bostonâ€™s area. A model like this would be very valuable for a real state agent who could make use of the information provided in a dayly basis.
